##  What This Indicator Does

This tool calculates how much money you will lose **if all Stop Losses are hit** across your open trades.

It displays:

• Total % risk based on your account reference size  
• Total money at risk in dollars  
• Risk per individual trade  
• Clean vertical trade list  
• Overflow protection if you have many trades open

##  Why This Is Different

Most traders calculate risk before entering.  
This shows your **actual live risk** after execution.

No spreadsheets. No mental math. No assumptions.
